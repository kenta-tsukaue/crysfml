! 6/87-5/88; MMJT: Original versions were named 'betaPXD' and 'FauPXD'.*
! They were 'hardwired' for simulating PXD patterns from zeolite beta, *
! and the faujasite/'Breck's structure 6' zeolite family.              *
!                                                                      *
! 5-8/88; MWD: Completely rewritten in generalized form by Mike Deem   *
! for Cray and VAX, and named 'PDS'.                                   *
!                                                                      *
! 8/88-11/89; MMJT: Deem's code was extended and mostly rewritten.     *
! Control file option added. Improved handling of sharp peaks.         *
! Symmetry testing added. Layer 'stacking uncertainty' factors added.  *
! Selected area electron diffraction option added.                     *
! Explicit layer sequencing option. Optimization of layer form factor  *
! calculations. Renamed 'DIFFaX' for, (D)iffraction (I)ntensities      *

! 12/89 - 3/90; MMJT: Finite crystal thickness now accepted under      *
!              'RECURSIVE' option. Self-consistency check of atomic    *
!               coordinates in data file. (v1.76)                      *

! 4/90 - 12/90; MMJT: Bug fixes. Streamlined 'data.sfc' file.          *
!               (v1.761 and v1.762)                                    *
!                                                                      *
! 1/91; MMJT: Eliminated the use of scratch file while reading data.   *
!             GETLNE now handles multiple, nested, comments (v1.763)   *
!                                                                      *
! 5/91; MMJT: Eliminated bug in default tolerance parameter. Added     *
!             average crystal composition printout to dump file.       *
!             (v1.764)                                                 *

! 8/91; MMJT: Replaced the LU decomposition routines CLUDCM and CLUBKS *
!             (from "Numerical Recipes") with the faster linpack       *
!             routines, CGEFA and CGESL (v1.765)                       *

! 8/91; MMJT: Improved sharp peak detection - use peak widths rather   *
!             than the more complicated phase coherence argument in    *
!             subroutine SHARP (v1.766)                                *

! 4/92; MMJT: Fixed bug in INTEN2 where last layer in an explicit      *
!             sequence was inadvertently assigned a scattering factor  *
!             of C_ONE. Improved error checking for explicit layers so *
!             that when alpha(j,i) = 0, an error is issued if j        *
!             follows i. XP_MAX increased to 5000. GETLNE now checks   *
!             that data lines do not exceed maximum length. (v1.767)   *
!                                                                      *
! 12/94; MMJT:Reinstated the use of the scratch file that had been     *
!             eliminated in v1.763. The Cray, and Microsoft fortran    *
!             compiler for PC, adhere to the FORTRAN77 standard and    *
!             do not allow unformatted reads/writes from/to strings.   *
!                                                           (v1.768)   *
!                                                                      *
! 1/95; MMJT: Finessed the diffraction symmetry detection routines.    *
!             Introduced the subroutine THRESH. (v1.769)               *
!                                                                      *
! 2/95; MMJT: Fixed glitches in THRESH, TST_MIR and TST_ROT that were  *
!             introduced in the 1/95 fix. (still v1.769)               *
!                                                                      *
! 3/95; MMJT: Implemented Debye-Scherrer type broadening due to finite *
!             lateral layer widths. Added CHWDTH, RDWDTH. Modified the *
!             way the powder pattern is written to the array spec, so  *
!             that the low angle intensity begins at spec(1). Atom     *
!             names are now case insensitive. The layer Bij factors    *
!             were reordered - B23, B31 become B13, B23.               *
!             GET_G modified to handle singularities better. (v1.80)   *
!                                                                      *
! 7/95; MMJT: Fixed rare zero integration range bug in GLQ16.          *
!             Fixed "fatsWalla" bug in GET_MAT.  (v1.801)              *
!                                                                      *
! 5/96; MMJT: Fixed a bug in the LL() function in INTEGR() which was   *
!             introduced by a "cosmetic" change in v1.801.  (v1.802)   *
!                                                                      *
! 10/96; MMJT:Changed eps3 to eps5 in CHWDTH function so that the      *
!             broadening tails extend further.  (v1.803)               *
!                                                                      *
! 7/97; MMJT: Added subroutines NXTARG and RDNMBR. These allow data    *
!             to be entered as fractions (ie 1/3). Improved robustness *
!             of the "fatswalla" interlayer uncertainty code. (v1.804) *
!                                                                      *
! 6/98; MMJT: Fixed bug in PV() that was introduced in v1.80. (v1.805) *
!                                                                      *
! 3/00; MMJT: Now allow 16-bit deep SADPs. (v1.806)                    *
!                                                                      *
! 8/00; MMJT: RDSTAK changed so that if a stacking probability is zero,*
!             the rest of the line is ignored.        (v1.807)         *
!                                                                      *
! 4/02; MMJT: Removed the non-standard calls to iidnnt in WRTSADP.     *
!                                                      (v1.808)        *
!                                                                      *
! 2/03; MMJT: Halved the value of ffhkcnst in GETSPC. The half-width   *
!             was being used instead of the FWHM, which made the shape *
!             broadening twice as large as it should be. (v1.809)      *
!                                                                      *
! 3/04; MMJT: Fixed a minor printing bug in TST_MIR.     (v1.810)      *
!                                                                      *
! 1/05; MMJT: Fixed some f77 compiler compatibility bugs.  (v1.811)    *
!                                                                      *
! 7/05; MMJT: Fixed a bug in EQUALB that caused DIFFaX to ignore the   *
!             sign of the Fats-Waller Bij terms.  (v1.812)             *
!                                                                      *
! 5/10; MMJT: Changed the way WRTSADP writes big-endian 16-bit data.   *
!             Improved scratch-file clean-up.                (v1.813)  *
!                                                                      *
!    WRTSADP has been removed in the present version for FAULTS (JRC)  *                                                       *

! DIFFaX first searches the current directory for a control file named *
! 'control.dif'. If it finds this file it opens it on unit 'cntrl'     *
! and this becomes the default input unit. Structure filenames,        *
! and the various parameters (which would normally be requested        *
! interactively) obviously must be in the correct sequence. The data   *
! read from 'control' is echoed on the default output device (ie. the  *
! screen, unit 'op') so the user can check that the responses          *
! are properly synchronized. If 'control.dif' does not exist, the      *
! default input device is the keyboard (unit number 'ip'), and the     *
! user is expected to answer the prompts. DIFFaX will loop through the *
! contents of 'control', and thus can be used to rerun DIFFaX on fresh *
! data files, without quitting. Under direction from a control file,   *
! normal termination of DIFFaX occurs when a filename 'END' is         *
! encountered. Interactively, DIFFaX will end normally when the user   *
! chooses not to return to the function menu.                          *
! The name of the control file is stored in the global character       *
! variable 'cfname', and is assigned in 'main'.                        *
!                                                                      *

! The structure input file is opened on unit 'df'. It can have any     *
! name except 'END' (case insensitive). For clarity it may be best to  *
! keep it short (less than 8 characters) and (optionally) with '.dat'  *
! appended. Output files use the input name up to the first blank      *
! (' ') or period ('.') as their root name. Thus, if 'beta.dat'        *
! (or 'beta') is the data input file name, then 'beta.spc' etc... will *

! Title: DIFFaX
! Authors: MWD and MMJT
! Date: 23 Oct 1988
! Description: This is the main program. First, important global
! constants, such as PI, are defined. The name of the control file
! is assigned to cfname, and then FNDCTL searches for this file in the
! current directory. If found, the control file is opened and it
! becomes the default input device. If not found, then the keyboard is
! the standard input device. The user's data file, and the atomic
! scattering factor data file (whose name is contained in 'sfname')
! are then searched for in the current directory (GETFIL), and opened.
! The user's data file is then read (RDFILE). The standard scattering
! factor data file 'sfname' is then searched for data on the atom
! types specified by the user (SFC). The layer existence
! probabilities are calculated (GET_G). If the user data file
! requested EXPLICIT, RANDOM stacking, then DIFFaX computes a random
! layer sequence consistent with the stacking probabilities (GETLAY).
! Reciprocal lattice constants related to the unit cell are then
! calculated (SPHCST). If the user requested (either interactively,
! or through the control file) a dump of what DIFFaX read from the
! user's data file, then an annotated dump is generated (DUMP). DETUN
! then delicately adjusts the probability data so as to avoid zero
! determinants at the sharp peaks. The user is then asked if a dump
! of DIFFaX's symmetry evaluations is required, and then searches the
! data looking for simple opportunities to speed up the calculation
! (OPTIMZ). The user is then asked if he wants to calculate the
! intensity at a point (POINT), along a streak (GOSTRK), integrated
! within a defined interval (GOINTR), a powder pattern (GOSPEC) or
! a selected area diffraction pattern (GOSADP). If running
! interactively, the user can return to any of these menu options,
! except if GOSPEC was chosen, where DIFFaX will finish. If a control
! file is being used, then DIFFaX will return to the beginning if
! GOSPEC was chosen. If a new data file name is read then DIFFaX will
! run again. If the control file reads 'End' (case insensitive) as the
! new file name, then DIFFaX will finish.
! Note: The file names contained in 'cfname' and 'sfname', and the name
! 'End' are reserved names, and cannot be used by the user as data file
! names.
